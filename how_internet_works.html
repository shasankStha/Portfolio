        <b>Simple Network</b>
        <br><br>
        Connecting computers through wired or wireless medium for communication is a Network. While connecting many computers through wire, it gets complicited.To solve this problem each computer in the network is connected to a <i>router</i>. Router makes sure that messages sent from a computer reaches it's correct destination. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>A network of networks</b>
        <br><br>
        While connecting millions of computers, we can connect computers to routers and routers to other routers. By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale infinitely. Such network comes really close to a internet. But we are still not connected worldwide. So, we connect our network to the telephone infrastructure through a special equipment called <i>modem</i>.
        <br><br>
        Modem turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.<br><br>
        The next step is to send the message from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to an <i>Internet Service Provider(ISP)</i>. An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that areall linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers.

    <b>Finding computers</b>
    <br><br>
    If we want to send a message to a computer, we have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address thet identifies it which is called as IP address.

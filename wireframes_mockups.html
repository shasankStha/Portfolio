    <h2><u>Wireframes</u></h2>
    <p>
        A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you and your programmmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.
        <br><br>
        Nailing down a good interface surface is possibly the most important part of designing a software. Doing the work now, before any code is written and before the visual design is finalized will save lots of time and painful adjustment work for later.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Why wireframes look the way they do?</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wireframes make it clear that this is not the final design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wireframes convey that, "this is all up for discussion".
        </li>
        <li>
            Wireframes makes it clear that no code has been written yet.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3><strong>When should we use a wireframe?</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Communicate structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Quick design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Product discovery
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><u>Mockup</u></h2>
    <p>
        Mockups are high-fidelity renders of your product's design that show case how the finished product will look. A mockup can take the shape of an image or product model and you generally create them using "digital design tool".
    </p>
    <h3><strong>When should you use mockup?</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Product discovery.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep stakeholders aligned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Final step in the design.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2><u>Prototype</u></h2>
    <p>
        Prototype are models of project that can take on different purpose. The most common use case in a design with a focus on functionality which helps separate them from wireframes and mockups.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>When should you use a prototype?</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Usability testing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Idea validation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Collaboration design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tempetating investors and updating stakeholders.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Even though there are few differences, wireframe, mockup and prototype are quite similar. Because of their similarities, we can develop one into next throughout design process. A wireframe can be outline for a mockup and adding functionality to mockup can make it a prototype.
